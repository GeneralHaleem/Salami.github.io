The Internet also provides the means to effectively analytical tools to study disease and its spread, thereby helping us understand the consequences of a pandemic.

									<p>Data cleaning is a necessary step between data collection and data analysis. Raw primary data is often imperfect and needs to be prepared for prime quality analysis and overall replicability. In sporadic cases, the only preparation required is dataset documentation. However, in most cases, data cleaning requires significant energy and attention.
										The goal of data cleaning is to scrub individual data points and to form the dataset simply usable and graspable for the analysis team and external users.
										In this Project, I used python to clean the Nashville Housing Data.</p>

									<p>Most people concur that the quality of your insights and analysis while utilizing data depends on the data you are using. In essence, bad data in equals bad analysis out. If you want to develop a culture inside your business centered around sound data decision-making, one of the most crucial first stages is data cleaning, also known as data cleansing and data scrubbing.

									<p>Web scraping plays a bigger and bigger role as the digital economy grows.
										APIs are not always accessible. Sometimes you have to manually scrape information from a website.
										A method for gathering information and data from the internet is called web scraping (also known as data scraping). To allow for future manipulation and analysis, this data is often stored in a local file. Web scraping is similar to copying and pasting text from a webpage into an Excel spreadsheet but on a much smaller scale.
										Web scraping has several uses, particularly in the area of data analytics. Companies that do market research use scrapers to collect information from online forums or social media for purposes like consumer sentiment analysis. To help competitor analysis, some people scrape data from product websites like Amazon or eBay.
										I used Jumia, a pan-African technology firm with a marketplace, shipping service, and payment service, as the source of the data for my project. using Requests and BeautifulSoup.</p>

									<p>My father and his friend had an argument about airplane crashes a while ago; his friend claimed that the rate of airplane crashes was much higher in the 1980s compared to the 1950s (the period they were born), but my father disagreed, claiming that the rate of crashes was higher in the 1950s. They quickly pulled out their phones to check Google, but they couldn't get a precise answer, so they quickly changed the subject. 
										I've had problems explaining to my father what a data analyst actually does, so I took this as a chance to demonstrate my skills. I instantly put my current course on hold and went to Kaggle to get the data I would need for this analysis.
										At the time this dataset was created on Kaggle, the original version was hosted by Open Data by Socrata, but unfortunately, that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data on airplane accidents involving civil, commercial, and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.
										The data was unclean and needed to be cleaned, so I used Excel to clean and transform it. The dataset was then imported into MySQL for analysis and then visualized with Tableau.
